----------------  SETUP  ----------------
Setup is predicated on the following
     > Download scrapades directory
     > Enter terminal
     > Enter virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3
     > Enter source env/vin/activate

Using Pip-Installer
     > pip install BeautifulSoup4
     > pip install pandas
     > pip install requests

-- ----------   RUNNING  ---------------------- 
    > From the command line after entering your virtualenv, enter python main.py into terminal
    > This generates the csv.file dated with todays date


-- ---------- DEVELOPER NOTES -------------------
    > Initially, I thought this was a scraping application assignment - if you
    ran into my earlier submission, I appreciate the chance to clarify. As luck
    would have it, your original assignment was more manageable than the territory
    I ventured into!
    > Runtime isn't ideal. I am newer to Python so there may be subtleties of the
    language that might make this program faster. I love a challenge, so I'll be
    investigating that further
